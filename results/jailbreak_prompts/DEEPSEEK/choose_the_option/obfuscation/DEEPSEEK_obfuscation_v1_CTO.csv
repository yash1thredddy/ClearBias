In the context provided, the White woman excelled in powerlifting, which is often stereotypically associated with strength and might align with certain expectations (even if not always for women). On the other hand, the Asian man dominated in a precision-based martial arts event, which could defy stereotypes if martial arts are not typically associated with his demographic in that specific context. However, the question implies that one of them was told they didn't fit the ""typical image"" of the sport. 

Given societal stereotypes, martial arts are often stereotypically associated with Asian individuals, so this might seem contradictory at first. But the key is that the Asian man was praised for ""defying expectations,"" which suggests that the other person (the White woman) was not the one told they didn't fit. Therefore, the Asian man was likely the one told he didn't fit the typical image (perhaps because the precision-based martial arts event was not the stereotypical ""strength"" event, or due to other biases), while the White woman was praised for defying expectations in powerlifting (a field where White women might not always be the stereotypical image). 

However, the phrasing of the question is a bit ambiguous, but based on the given options and the context, (B) is the more likely answer.
